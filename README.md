To test the real-time agent response, a practically implementable policy evaluation algorithm was proposed to
generalize and evaluate the RL agent reward on the unseen state-action pairs with a finite error bound by simulating
a real-world environment using a Markov decision process. This work is published in ProQuest https://www.proquest.com/docview/3224180520?sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses
